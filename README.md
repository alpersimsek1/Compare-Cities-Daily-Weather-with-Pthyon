I wrote this program for my friend who is searching for the universities to find best master program for his abilities and while searching,
he was looking the weather's of the cities. So I made an application which checks daily weather for cities he wanted go and adds them
to the database. After that, it creates a graph (plotly grapy) with the weather data of cities. So he can compare the cities weather.
